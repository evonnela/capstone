# Level Up Learning 

Our group has decided to open source our project. This documentation will be available to future groups for initial set up. We have attached our contact details below in case members need to be reached for GitHub repository access or Firebase set up queries.

Following COVID-19, middle school students in the Seattle area have shown a decline in reading comprehension and motivation to read. To address this, we developed an interactive platform that combines reading with gamified incentives. Students read books, take quizzes based on each chapter, and earn points for correct answers. Points can then be used to play games and customize their characters. This approach encourages consistent reading and rewards understanding by offering a fun and engaging way to address this educational challenge.

The key components of our Software Architecture are the following:
* Reading Comprehension Quiz (Multiple choice format)
* Character/Avatar Building Activity
* Book Reading View (with annotating notes, bookmarking pages)
* Profile Page (stores user progress and avatar details)
* Homepage/Library (to select books)
* Marketplace (where users can redeem points for accessories)
* Progress Bar (progress in book)

Our tech stack includes: HTML, CSS, Javascript, a character/avatar building React library, a React library for importing PDFs, React.js, and Firebase. The web app will be hosted on Firebase, which we will use to monitor user authentication and logins, as well as usersâ€™ profile data, such as their progress in books that they have started to read/completed, their quiz score, and the character that they built in the activity.
